This project needs clarifications as to the goal and scope of the project, how the two resources above relate (or don't), and how they might duplicate efforts that exist other places in Maine (e.g., https://211maine.org/ )

We have a fair amount of info collected; should the google doc remain open for folks to edit? Should there be a comment system to suggest missing resources? Should there be a database on the back end? What's the best way to present the info to others?
